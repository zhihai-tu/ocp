Which statement is true about Oracle Net Listener?  

A.It acts as the listening endpoint for the Oracle database instance for all local and non-local user connections. 
B.A single listener can service only one database instance and multiple remote client connections.
C.Service registration with the listener is performed by the process monitor (LREG) process of each database instance. 
D.The listener.ora configuration file must be configured with one or more listening protocol addresses to allow remote users to connect to a database instance. 
E.The listener.ora configuration file must be located in the ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directly.
正确答案是 C
【解析】
【C】The listener registration process (LREG) registers information about the database instance and dispatcher processes with the Oracle Net Listener.
When an instance starts, LREG polls the listener to determine whether it is running. If the listener is running, then LREG passes it relevant parameters. If it is not running, then LREG periodically attempts to contact it.
【B】A single service, as known by a listener, can identify one or more database instances. Also, a single database instance can register one or more services with a listener. Clients connecting to a service need not specify which instance they require.

Which activity is audited by default and recorded in the operating system audit trail irrespective of whether or not database auditing is enabled? 

A.execution of SQL statements by users connected with the SYSDBA privilege 
B.creation of a fine-grained audit policy
C.configuration of unified auditing mode 
D.usage of the AUDIT statement
正确答案是 A
【参考】https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/network.111/b28531/auditing.htm#DBSEG0622
【解析】Oracle Database always audits certain database-related operations and writes them to the operating system audit files. It includes the actions of any user who is logged in with the SYSDBA or SYSOPER privilege. This is called mandatory auditing. Even if you have enabled the database audit trail (that is, setting the AUDIT_TRAIL parameter to DB), Oracle Database still writes mandatory records to operating system files.
